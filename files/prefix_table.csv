# This file contains ADDITIONAL prefixes to add to the built-in
# prefixes that TADA uses for archive filenames. A lookup into the
# table is done based upon the first three fields (site, telescope,
# instrument) to get the forth field (prefix).  Its possible for
# multiple "keys" to yield the same prefix. Fields after the forth are
# ignored. Any lines starting with "#" are ignored.
#
# For existing archive file naming conventions, see:
